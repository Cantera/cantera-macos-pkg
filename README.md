# Cantera macOS Matlab Interface Builder

**Note**: This repository is in a holding state after the [removal of the legacy Matlab Toolbox](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/1670) from Cantera. There is a new [experimental Matlab interface](https://github.com/Cantera/enhancements/issues/177) in progress. When that interface is stable, this repository can be used again to build the Matlab interface for distribution.

---

This repository runs a GitHub Actions job to build installers for the Matlab interface of Cantera. It uses the [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) app by St√©phane Sudre to build the installer package for distribution. The current version of that app in this repository is 1.2.10 (development build from [Nov. 26, 2021](https://github.com/packagesdev/packages/issues/97#issuecomment-947189086)). At least this version is required to support Apple Silicon/M1/ARM architecture. The source code for the Packages app is on [GitHub](https://github.com/packagesdev/packages).

Open `cantera-matlab-interface.pkgproj` with the version of Packages from this repository installed locally on your computer and edit all the version numbers. Also change the environment name in `support_files/readme.rtf`. Make sure not to remove end-of-line spaces in the `readme.rtf` file. Then go to <https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-macos-pkg/actions/workflows/main.yml> and click _Run workflow_. Specify the Git tag to be built from `Cantera/cantera`.

This build is run on every commit to the main branch of `Cantera/cantera`, as well as each tagged commit on `Cantera/cantera`.

The workflow creates an artifact for each job that contains the built pkg file.
