# Cantera macOS Matlab Interface Builder

This repository runs a GitHub Actions job to build installers for the Matlab interface of
Cantera. It uses the [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) app by
St√©phane Sudre to build the installer package for distribution. The current version of that app in
this repository is 1.2.10 (development build from [Nov. 26, 2021](https://github.com/packagesdev/packages/issues/97#issuecomment-947189086)). At least this version is required to support Apple Silicon/M1/ARM architecture. The source code for the Packages app is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/packagesdev/packages).

To make a new release, change the `ref` key for the Cantera checkout action to point to the appropriate branch/tag.
That should be on line 26 of `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
Open `cantera-matlab-interface.pkgproj` with the version of Packages from this repository installed
locally on your computer and edit all the version numbers. Also change the environment name
in `support_files/readme.rtf`. Make sure not to remove end-of-line spaces in the `readme.rtf` file.

The workflow creates an artifact for each job that contains the built pkg file.
