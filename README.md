# Cantera macOS Matlab Interface Builder

This repository runs a Travis CI job to build release installers for the Matlab interface of
Cantera. It uses the [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html) app by
St√©phane Sudre to build the installer package for distribution. The current version of that app in
this repository is 1.2.3. The source code for the Packages app is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/packagesdev/packages).

To prepare a new release, change the version number on lines 6, 44, and 52 of `.travis.yml`.
Also change the version numbers on lines 830, 1677, 2184, 2772, and 3290 of
`cantera-matlab-interface.pkgproj`.
