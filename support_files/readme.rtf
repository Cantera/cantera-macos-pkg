\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to the Cantera Matlab interface installer for macOS/OS X. This package installs only the Matlab interface for Cantera. To use it, you will require the Python interface as well. If you do not already have the Python interface, you should install it using Anaconda or Miniconda. Directions to do this are available on our website at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cantera.org/install/index.html"}}{\fldrslt https://cantera.org/install/index.html}}. Note that you must install the Conda package into the base environment of your Anaconda install.\
\
This package installs the Cantera Matlab interface to the ~/Applications/Cantera folder. To uninstall, simply remove that folder and remove any lines that were added to ~/Documents/startup.m.}
